# giphy-app
A dynamic page built with javascript, jquery, and the giphy API.

Overview: This simple app pre-populates the DOM with an array of buttons + topics that will access the top 10 gifs returned 
for that search term with Giphy. Gifs are displayed initially as still images that will animate on click. Each user can add
as many additional buttons of their choice as they wish.

Side note: Popcorn should have been in the original array. Prioritize relevant food gifs always!
